# Directories for managing the deposits. The lifecycle of a deposit is:
#
# 1.   Created in the drafts directory.
# 2.   On submit: copied to stage and then that copy is moved to the submit-to directory.
# 3a)  If archived successfully the bag in the draft-copy is deleted
# 3b)  If the deposit is rejected, the depositor can reopen the draft, modify it and resubmit it.

# Settings for user authentication. The LDAP directory at ldap-url is used to check the credentials
# of the user by trying to access the entry:
#
# <ldap-user-id-attr-name>=<username>, <ldap-parent-entry>
#
# For example user jdoe wants to connect. With the defaults this will result in easy-deposit-api
# to try and access
#
# uid=jdoe,ou=users,ou=easy,dc=dans,dc=knaw,dc=nl
#
# LDAP should be set up so as to only allow access to users with the correct password.
