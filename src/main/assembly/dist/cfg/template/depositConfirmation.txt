DEPOSIT AGREEMENT
Attached is a copy of the deposit agreement concluded between you and DANS when you deposited the dataset.

PROCESSING AGREEMENT
When your dataset includes personal data within the meaning of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) the data controller under the GDPR and DANS must conclude a processing agreement. DANS will contact you for concluding this agreement when you indicated that your dataset contains personal data or when DANS has reason to believe that this is the case. A processing agreement does not apply if your dataset only contains personal data to account for the dataset, such as the ‘Creator’ (one of the metadata fields) or citations.
