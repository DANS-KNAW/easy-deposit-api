# Directories for managing the deposits.
#
# - staged:           Directory has two functions:
#                     - staging area for POST uploads and submits.
#                     - optimistic locking of uploads (both POST and PUT) and submits.
#                     A completed draft is copied here when the user submits a deposit.
#                     Multipart files of POST uploads are copied here before
#                     running checks and moving them as payload into a bag.
#                     PUT uploads are directly streamed into a bag, so the corresponding
#                     temporary directory will remain empty, it only serves locking.
# - drafts:           contains the draft deposits; single files are uploaded here directly,
#                     unzipped directories and deposits are moved here from staged.
# - stage-for-submit: the completed draft is copied here when the user submits it.
# - submit-to:        the deposit copy in staged is moved here on successful completion
#                     of a submit request.  As moving is an atomic action this prevents further
#                     processing of incomplete deposits.
#
# N.B. multipart.location, staged, drafts and submit-to must all be located on the same partition
# in order to support atomic moving.
#
# Note that a directory in the staged folder only has temporary content, the service should
# clear it automatically on completion of a request. The error message of a startup failure explains
# what to do with leftovers of a hard shutdown.
