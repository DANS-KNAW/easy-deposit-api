# Directories for managing the deposits.
#
# - stage-zips:       is used for uploads of zipped directories or complete deposits.
# - drafts:           contains the draft deposits; single files are uploaded here directly,
#                     unzipped directories and deposits are moved here from stage-zips.
# - stage-for-submit: the completed draft is copied here when the user submits it.
# - submit-to:        the deposit copy in stage-for-submit is moved here on successful completion
#                     of a submit request.  As moving is an atomic action this prevents further
#                     processing of incomplete deposits.
#
# N.B. stage-zips and drafts must be located on the same partition in order to support atomic moving.
# The same holds for stage-for-submit and submit-to.
#
# Note that the stage-* directories only have temporary content, so the service should clear them
# automatically on completion of a request.
