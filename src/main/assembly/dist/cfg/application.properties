# Directories for managing the deposits. The lifecycle of a deposit is:
#
# 1.   Created in the drafts directory.
# 2.   On submit: copied to stage and then that copy is moved to the submit-to directory.
# 3a)  If archived successfully the bag in the draft-copy is deleted
# 3b)  If the deposit is rejected, the depositor can reopen the draft, modify it and resubmit it.
#
# stage and submit-to must be on a single mount to allow moving
# stage.upload and draft must be on a single mount to allow moving
