    * **Note 1:** the form of the routes is the same as for regular files, but the allowed methods are
    **not** the same.

    * **Note 2:** Swagger insists that `dir_path` cannot be optional. However, the directory operations
    are also valid for the root directory of the deposit, i.e. with `dir_path` empty.

        The header area of each part specifies the file name using a `Content-Disposition` header.

        If the body contains **only one part** and that part has `Content-Type: application/zip`
        or `Content-Type: application/tar-compressed`, then the body
        is a file in archive format. This archive file can contain a directory hierarchy. The archive file will be
        unpacked in `dir_path`. For each file in the archive file, the path in the deposit will be `dir_path`/`path_in_archive`.
        The archive file may contain `nested archive files`, which will **not** be extracted, but stored as is.

        Existing files at the target location will be overwritten, existing folders at the target location will be merged with the folders in the zip.
        Concurrent POST or PUT calls to the same deposit are not allowed.
