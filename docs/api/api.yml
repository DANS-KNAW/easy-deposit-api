    * **Note 1:** the form of the routes is the same as for regular files, but the allowed methods are
    **not** the same.

    * **Note 2:** Swagger insists that `dir_path` cannot be optional. However, the directory operations
    are also valid for the root directory of the deposit, i.e. with `dir_path` empty.
